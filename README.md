# Minecraft Bikes Mod

This mod adds simple, easy to use bicycles into Minecraft.

## Why use bikes?
Bikes are alternatives to current modes of transportation in the vanilla game of Minecraft such as Horses, or Minecarts. Some advantages bikes have over current modes of transportation are:

- Do not require rails to move  
- Do not need to be tamed or saddled  

## How do they work?
Bikes can be used just like any other type of transportation, right clicking on a bike will allow the players to start riding it, unless the bike is locked. Using the W key while riding the bike will cause the bike to move forward at a speed based on the gear which it is set to.

## Different types of bikes
The Bikes mod will add a variety of different bikes which have their special features.

### Mountain Bikes (Coming Soon)
Mountain Bikes can conquer almost any terrain whether is be road, dirt, etc. They come with front suspension, and sometimes come with rear suspension.

### Road Bikes (Coming Soon)
Road Bikes are simple enough, Bikes for the road. Road Bikes can easily conquer flat and smooth terrain such as concrete, stone, etc. Off road Road Bikes may slow down or not function at all.

## Features
### Locking Bikes
Bikes can be locked using the Bike Lock Item. When a bike is locked, player will not be able to ride or push the bike. Bikes can be easily unlocked by the owner of the locked bike by right clicking it.

### Gear System (Coming Soon)
Bikes will have changeable rear and front gears, the higher the gear, the more energy will be used, which in turn, reduces the player's hunger. Though more energy will be used in higher gears, speed of the vehicle will also increase.

### Suspension (Coming Soon)
Some types of Bikes have suspension, which will reduce the amount of fall damage taken when riding a bike.
